# Compass for Protractor
* * *

A page-object component model for Protractor by AngularJS.

CSS selectors drive pretty much all the interesting things you can do with the framework. 
But we don’t want CSS selectors all over our testing code, 
and certainly don’t want to repeat the same selectors again and again.

Compass provides (1) a DSL for creating page objects that model the hierarchical structure of HTML 
and (2) custom assertions that can be used when writing end-to-end tests.
